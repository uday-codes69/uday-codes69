# 👋 Hi, I'm Uday thakur

Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a passionate developer and open-source contributor focused on **Machine Learning, MLOps, and AI**. I'm currently preparing for **Google Summer of Code 2026**, and contributing to projects that align with real-world ML workflows — especially those involving **Kubeflow**, **DeepChem**, and scalable ML infrastructure.

## 🚀 Learning Goals (2025–26)

🎯 **Short-Term Goals (Now – Dec 2025):**
- Solidify core **ML skills**: Supervised/Unsupervised learning, Model Evaluation
- Explore **AutoML** and **Pipeline creation** using Kubeflow
- Learn **Kubernetes fundamentals** for MLOps workflows
- Contribute to beginner-friendly issues in open-source ML tools

🧠 **Next Phase (Jan – Feb 2026):**
- Start **Deep Learning** with TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Build and deploy ML models using **Kubeflow Pipelines**
- Design and propose a strong **GSoC 2026 project**
